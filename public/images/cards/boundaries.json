  "generatedText": "Here's a detailed prompt designed to capture that specific vision:\n\n---\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA whimsical, dreamlike illustration combining the ethereal glow of chalk lines with the soft translucence of watercolor washes on textured paper. The aesthetic is a delicate blend of digital painting and traditional media, emphasizing a handcrafted feel.\n\nAt the heart of the scene is a simple, expressive stick figure. It is entirely composed of luminous, glowing white and cyan light, radiating a gentle, soft-focus aura that subtly illuminates its immediate surroundings. The stick figure's pose conveys hopeful curiosity, perhaps taking a tentative step towards or just through an open threshold. Its 'limbs' are fluid lines of light, slightly blurred at the edges as if vibrating with energy.\n\nThe figure stands before a whimsical, colorful fence with an open gate. The fence is imagined in soft, undulating lines, perhaps with pastel-colored posts and crossbeams that seem to gently curve and sway, almost like a storybook illustration. It's rendered in soft watercolor washes – think muted peaches, mint greens, lavender, and sky blues – with delicate, slightly textured colored pencil outlines that give it form without being rigid. The gate is wide open, inviting, a clear threshold, its opening framed by the glowing light of the stick figure.\n\nThe environment around the figure is oversized and metaphorical, rendered in loose, flowing watercolor washes and delicate colored pencil strokes. Imagine soft, rolling hills or abstract, cloud-like forms in the background, subtly hinting at a vast, imaginative landscape. These elements are intentionally vague and dreamlike, allowing for interpretation, with colors like soft gradients of pinks, blues, purples, and yellows blending seamlessly into each other, creating a sense of depth and wonder.\n\nThe sole light source emanates magically from the glowing stick figure itself. This creates a soft, ethereal glow that subtly illuminates the immediate surroundings, casting gentle highlights on the fence and a soft radiance on the ground directly beneath and around the figure. The rest of the scene is bathed in a soft, ambient twilight or dawn-like glow, emphasizing the figure's luminosity.\n\nThe overall mood is profoundly hopeful, imaginative, and clean. The composition is minimalist, with abundant negative space surrounding the central elements, emphasizing the figure's journey and the openness of the gate, creating a sense of calm and potential. Focus on clean lines, delicate textures, and a serene atmosphere.\n\n**Artistic Modifiers:**\n*   **Style:** Whimsical illustration, dreamcore, ethereal art, glowing chalk art, soft watercolor painting, textured paper art.\n*   **Lighting:** Luminous, radiant, soft glow, magical lighting, ambient light.\n*   **Colors:** Pastel palette, iridescent, opalescent, aquamarine, lavender, peach, mint green, sky blue, glowing white, cyan.\n*   **Composition:** Minimalist, negative space, clean composition, rule of thirds, shallow depth of field.\n*   **Details:** Highly detailed, intricate, masterpiece, trending on artstation, 8k, sharp focus on figure, subtle textures.\n*   **Avoid:**",
