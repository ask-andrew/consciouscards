  "generatedText": "Here are a few options, ranging in specificity, to capture that beautiful concept:\n\n**Option 1 (Detailed & Comprehensive):**\n\n```\nA whimsical, dreamlike illustration in a mixed-media style. A simple, expressive stick figure, entirely composed of glowing white and cyan light, stands centrally, its luminous form casting a soft glow. It gently observes a pair of human hands carefully peeling back the translucent, vibrant layers of an oversized onion. The onion itself is a riot of soft, rich watercolor hues – deep purples, emerald greens, and warm oranges, with each peeled layer revealing more intense color, leading to a softly glowing, golden core at its heart. The background is minimalist, a soft wash of ethereal, muted watercolor and subtle colored pencil textures, creating an expansive, dreamlike negative space. The paper texture is subtly visible throughout. The entire scene is bathed in a magical, soft light that emanates directly from the glowing stick figure, casting a gentle radiance on the onion and hands. The glowing chalk lines define the stick figure and the onion's core, creating a luminous contrast against the soft watercolor washes. The overall mood is hopeful, imaginative, and clean. --ar 16:9 --v 5.2\n```\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly More Concise):**\n\n```\nWhimsical mixed-media illustration: glowing white and cyan chalk stick figure observing hands peeling a vibrant, oversized watercolor onion. The onion reveals a glowing core. Soft watercolor washes and colored pencil textures for a minimalist, dreamlike background with ample negative space. Magical light emanates from the stick figure. Hopeful, imaginative, clean aesthetic. Textured paper visible. --ar 3:2 --v 5.2\n```\n\n**Option 3 (Focus on Core Elements):**\n\n```\nPlayful illustration: glowing cyan stick figure interacting with a person peeling a vibrant watercolor onion to reveal a glowing core. Chalk lines for glow, soft watercolor for layers. Oversized, metaphorical scene with minimalist negative space. Magical light from the figure. Hopeful, clean, dreamlike. --ar 4:3 --v 5.2\n```\n\n**Key elements included in these prompts:**\n\n*   **Style:** \"whimsical, dreamlike illustration,\" \"mixed-media style,\" \"glowing chalk lines,\" \"soft watercolor washes,\" \"colored pencil textures,\" \"textured paper visible.\"\n*   **Subject:** \"simple, expressive stick figure,\" \"entirely composed of glowing white and cyan light.\"\n*   **Scene:** \"person peeling layers of a vibrant onion,\" \"oversized onion,\" \"glowing core.\"\n*   **Environment:** \"minimalist background,\" \"soft wash of ethereal, muted watercolor,\" \"expansive, dreamlike negative space.\"\n*   **Lighting:** \"magical, soft light that emanates directly from the glowing stick figure.\"\n*   **Mood:** \"hopeful, imaginative, clean.\"\n*   **Composition:** \"minimalist,\" \"ample negative space.\"\n\nRemember to experiment with aspect ratios (`--ar`) and potentially different `--v` versions if you're using Midjourney or similar tools!",
