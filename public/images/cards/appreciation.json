  "generatedText": "Here's a detailed prompt designed to capture that specific vision, perfect for an AI image generator like Midjourney:\n\n---\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nA whimsical, dreamlike illustration in a mixed-media style, combining glowing chalk lines on subtly textured, off-white paper with soft, ethereal watercolor washes.\n\nThe main subject is a simple, expressive stick figure, entirely composed of luminous white and cyan light. The figure's lines are drawn with the texture of glowing chalk, slightly smudged and radiant. It stands with open hands, gently cupped and slightly upturned, conveying a sense of wonder and receptiveness.\n\nA delicate shower of shimmering golden stars cascades down from above, landing softly into the figure's open hands and gently bouncing off its glowing form, creating tiny, ephemeral sparks. The stars themselves have a soft, iridescent glow.\n\nThe environment around the figure is oversized and metaphorical, rendered in loose, translucent watercolor washes and subtle colored pencil details. Imagine soft, rolling hills that could be clouds or gentle waves, or perhaps oversized, translucent petals of a dream-flower, fading into a vast, serene background. The colors of the environment are predominantly soft pastels – light blues, lavenders, pale greens, and creamy whites – creating an expansive, airy feel.\n\nThe lighting is magical, emanating softly from the glowing stick figure itself. This inner luminescence casts a gentle, diffused radiance outwards, subtly illuminating the surrounding watercolor elements and highlighting the texture of the paper. There's a soft halo effect around the figure.\n\nThe overall mood is profoundly hopeful, imaginative, and clean. The composition is minimalist, with abundant negative space surrounding the central figure and the falling stars, enhancing the dreamlike quality and focusing attention on the precious interaction.\n\n**Artistic Directives:**\n\n*   **Style:** Whimsical, playful, dreamlike, ethereal, mixed media.\n*   **Techniques:** Glowing chalk art, soft watercolor washes, colored pencil accents, textured paper.\n*   **Colors:** Luminous white, vibrant cyan, shimmering gold, soft pastels (light blue, lavender, pale green, cream).\n*   **Emphasis:** Glow effect, paper texture, expressive simplicity, negative space.\n*   **Mood:** Hopeful, imaginative, clean, serene, uplifting.\n\n--ar 16:9 --style raw --v 5.2",
