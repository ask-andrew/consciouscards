  "generatedText": "Here's a detailed prompt designed to capture that specific vision:\n\n\"A whimsical and playful illustration in a unique style combining the tactile feel of glowing chalk lines on textured, handmade paper with soft, ethereal watercolor washes.\n\nThe central focus is a simple, expressive stick figure, rendered entirely from luminous white and cyan light, its lines glowing with an inner radiance like a soft neon. The figure emanates a gentle, magical light that softly illuminates the entire scene. The stick figure's pose conveys a sense of gentle wonder and curiosity, perhaps with one arm slightly extended towards the bell.\n\nThe stick figure is interacting with a clear, shimmering bell. The bell itself is oversized, translucent, almost crystalline, and subtly vibrates, depicted as ringing a pure tone. This pure tone manifests as delicate, concentric ripples of soft, translucent watercolor and faint colored pencil lines, spreading outwards from the bell into the dreamlike space. The bell has a subtle iridescence, catching the light from the stick figure.\n\nThe environment around the figure is oversized and metaphorical, rendered in loose, flowing watercolor washes of soft blues, purples, and greens, with delicate colored pencil accents. Abstract, ethereal shapes and forms float or gently drift in the background, suggesting a vast, imaginative landscape without being concrete – perhaps soft, cloud-like forms, or gentle, undulating hills of color.\n\nThe overall mood is profoundly hopeful, imaginative, and clean. The composition is minimalist, with abundant negative space, drawing the viewer's eye to the intimate interaction between the luminous figure and the resonant bell. The textured paper adds a tactile, dreamy quality, enhancing the whimsical and ethereal atmosphere.\n\n*   **Art Style:** Glowing chalk lines, soft watercolor washes, colored pencil details.\n*   **Lighting:** Magical, emanating softly from the glowing stick figure.\n*   **Colors:** Predominantly cool tones (soft blues, purples, greens) for the environment, contrasting with the bright white and cyan glow of the figure and bell's shimmer.\n*   **Composition:** Minimalist, plenty of negative space, focus on the interaction.\n*   **Texture:** Visible paper texture, chalk dust effect, watercolor bleed.\"",
